Allows you to go to review posts and SIFT through comments.

A webapp that takes reddit post URLs as input, summarizes the initial post, 
and condenses/summarizes comments so people can get a general consensus on said post. 

Checkboxes:
-Consensus condensed
-include most upvoted comment, or exclude
-include most downvoted comment or exclude
-Option to scrape user data for fake or untruthful reviews (look for comment or post karma, account age)

The sorting criteria can change based on user input:
-Overall consensus
-Most repeated phrases
-Keywords/phrases
-Username

Project Overview
Your webpage will:

Accept Reddit post links as input.
Fetch the comments and commenters' account details from the Reddit API.
Sort and display the data based on your chosen criteria (e.g., comment karma, account age, etc.).
Steps to Build the Webpage

	1. Set Up the Development Environment
Choose a tech stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a framework like React).
Backend: Node.js, Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI), or similar.
Database: (Optional) SQLite or MongoDB if you need to store data.
Install necessary tools:
Node.js for JavaScript backend.
Python and pip for Python backend.

	2. Register a Reddit API Application
Go to Reddit Developer Portal.
Create an app and get the client ID and secret.

	3. Fetch Reddit Data
Use the Reddit API or a wrapper library:
Python: praw.
JavaScript: snoowrap.
Example Python snippet to fetch comments:
python
Copy code
________________________________________________________
import praw

reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    user_agent="YOUR_APP_NAME"
)
submission = reddit.submission(url="REDDIT_POST_LINK")
for comment in submission.comments.list():
    print(comment.body, comment.author.name)
	______________________________________________________

4. Process the Data
Extract details like:
Comment text.
Commenter's username.
Karma, account age, etc., from user profiles.
Use sorting algorithms or libraries to organize data.

5. Build the Webpage
Frontend:
Create an input field for the Reddit post link.
Display results in a table or cards.
Backend:
Create an API endpoint to process the link and return sorted data.
Use frameworks like Flask/Express.js to handle requests.

>>>>>Example API design:

POST /fetch_comments â†’ Accepts a Reddit post link, fetches and sorts data, returns JSON.
6. Display Data
Use JavaScript (or a library like React) to dynamically show sorted data on the webpage.
Add filters or sorting options (e.g., sort by comment length, karma, etc.).
7. Deployment
Host your webpage on platforms like:
Frontend: Netlify, Vercel.
Backend: Heroku, AWS, or Render.
Ensure you handle API rate limits from Reddit.

This is correct, and it would also need to have the option to search the post for repeated or similar phrases, and if the post is a review post, it should be able to give a summarized version of the commenters' reviews.

Great! These additional features make the project even more exciting. Here's how you can expand the functionality to include these features:

Additional Features
1. Search for Repeated or Similar Phrases
Objective: Identify frequently repeated or similar phrases in the comments to detect common topics or sentiments.

Implementation Steps:

Text Preprocessing:
Remove punctuation, stop words, and convert text to lowercase.
Tokenize the comments into words or phrases.
Phrase Frequency Analysis:
Use a library like collections.Counter (Python) or similar in JavaScript.
Identify n-grams (e.g., two- or three-word phrases) using tools like nltk (Python) or regex patterns.
Similarity Detection:
Use a text similarity metric like cosine similarity (via TF-IDF vectors) or Levenshtein distance.
Libraries:
Python: scikit-learn, fuzzywuzzy.
JavaScript: string-similarity.
Output:

Show a list of frequently repeated phrases with counts or similarity scores.
Highlight phrases in comments where they appear.
2. Summarize Review Comments
Objective: Provide a concise summary of the sentiment or key points from review-type comments.

Implementation Steps:

Comment Categorization:
Use keyword-based detection to filter review-related comments (e.g., look for "I think," "in my opinion," "review," etc.).
Alternatively, use sentiment analysis to focus on subjective comments.
Summarization:
Extractive Summarization:
Highlight key sentences using TextRank or similar algorithms.
Python libraries: sumy, spaCy, or gensim.
Abstractive Summarization:
Generate concise summaries using models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or Hugging Face models (e.g., BART, T5).
Sentiment Analysis:
Provide an overall sentiment score for the reviews (positive, negative, or neutral).
Libraries:
Python: nltk, TextBlob, VADER.
JavaScript: Sentiment.
Output:

Display a summary paragraph for the post, listing pros and cons based on keywords and sentiment.
Webpage Enhancements
Frontend
Add a phrase search field with options to filter results by:
Specific keywords.
Minimum similarity score.
Add a review summarization button to display:
A summarized version of the reviews.
A sentiment chart (bar or pie chart) using a library like Chart.js or D3.js.
Backend
Create additional API endpoints:
POST /search_phrases â†’ Accepts a phrase or similarity threshold, returns matches.
POST /summarize_reviews â†’ Returns summarized reviews and sentiment analysis.
Database (Optional)
Store processed data (e.g., frequent phrases, summaries) for faster retrieval if the same post is analyzed again.

Example Code Snippets

Phrase Frequency Analysis in Python
python
Copy code
from collections import Counter
from nltk import ngrams

def get_frequent_phrases(comments, n=2):
    all_phrases = []
    for comment in comments:
        tokens = comment.lower().split()
        all_phrases.extend(ngrams(tokens, n))
    return Counter(all_phrases).most_common(10)
Summarizing Reviews Using Hugging Face
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
comments = " ".join(review_comments)  # Combine review comments
summary = summarizer(comments, max_length=50, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
